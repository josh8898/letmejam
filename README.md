# letmejam

Website built with Python(Flask) and React JS, that allows guitar players to search and upload backing tracks to jam over. Will include details about the track's key, and scales/modes recommended for grooving over it. Details about each track are stored in a PostgreSQL database. Website will be hosted using AWS when it goes live.

Current Features:
* Users can upload tracks to the server
* MP3s can be streamed by the user

To Do:
* Implement a search function
* Implement more tables in the DB to store keywords relating to each track, as well as scales used to play over the backing track
* Make it look prettier!
* Push to public domain using AWS, look into delivering files to user via S3
